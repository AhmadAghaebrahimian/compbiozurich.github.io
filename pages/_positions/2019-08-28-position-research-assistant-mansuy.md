## {{ page.title }}

The laboratory of Neuroepigenetics is looking for a part time research assistant (student) in bioinformatics.  

The project is at the interface between computation and biology and aims to gain insight into the biological mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance. The purpose is to analyse multi-omics data including DNA methylome, transcriptome, chromatin structure, proteome and/or metabolome in mouse and rat models and/or humans using publically available and customized pipelines and algorithms. It could also involves a part on software development and improvement for multi-omics data analysis. The student will join a team of bioinformaticians and biologists who work together on the generation and analyses of experimental data.

Programming in R and knowledge of UNIX-like platform is required. Knowledge of Git and some experience in analyzing NGS data is advantageous. Applicants with research experience are particularly encouraged to apply. The position is available now. Applicants from biology, bioinformatics, mathematics, computer science, physics or any relevant interdisciplinary background are welcome.
Student will also receive some funding. Applications including a CV and letter of motivation should be sent to [Prof. Isabelle Mansuy](mansuy@hifo.uzh.ch).

Further details on the project can be obtained by email or phone contact.
