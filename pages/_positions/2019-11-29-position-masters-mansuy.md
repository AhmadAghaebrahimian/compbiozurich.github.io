The laboratory of Neuroepigenetics (lab of Prof. Dr. Isabelle Mansuy) is looking for a Masters student for a project in bioinformatics.


The project is at the interface between computation and biology and aims to gain insight into the biological mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance by mining data from the literature. The purpose is to analyze multi-omics data including DNA methylome, transcriptome, chromatin structure, proteome and/or metabolome in mouse and rat models and/or humans using publicly available and customized pipelines and algorithms. It also involves a part on software development and improvement for multi-omics data analysis.


Programming in R/Python and knowledge of UNIX-like platform is required. Knowledge of Git and some experience in analyzing NGS data is advantageous. Applicants with research experience are particularly encouraged to apply. The position is available now. Applicants from biology, bioinformatics, mathematics, computer science, physics or any relevant interdisciplinary background are welcome. Applicants with research experience are particularly encouraged to apply. The student will join a team of bioinformaticians and biologists who work together on the generation and analyses of experimental data.


Applications including a CV and a letter of motivation should be sent to Deepak Tanwar by email ([mailto:tanwar@hifo.uzh.ch]tanwar@hifo.uzh.ch). Further details on the project can be obtained from Deepak Tanwar by email or phone (+41 (0) 44 635 33 49).
