<img style="float: right; max-width: 40px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: -20px;" src="/assets/img/logo_beacon.png" />The Beacon protocol defines an open standard for genomics data discovery, developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics & Health. Since 2016, the Beacon protocols is being developed through the [ELIXIR Beacon project](https://beacon-project.io) as a GA4GH driver project.

As part of the project, the [Baudis group](http://info.baudisgroup.org) at the University of Zurich develops the [Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> demonstrator](https://beacon.progenetix.org), to demonstrate options for future Beacon protocol extensions.

The Beacon<sup><span style="color: #d00;">+</span></sup> implementation is a custom front end on top of the - among others - [Progenetix](https://progenetix.org) and [arrayMap](https://arraymap.org) datasets, with emphasis on structural genome variations from cancer samples.
