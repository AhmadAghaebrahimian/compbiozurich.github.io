__Abstract__ Apart from our original "abundance_correction" method aimed at the analysis of post-translationally-modified (PTM) proteins, we've expanded our existing web-tool. Novel functional categories such as Reactome, WikiPathways, and PubMed publications were added to the resource. But also non-binary functional associations from text mining are being used in conjunction with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to show enrichment for Diseases, Tissues, and Gene Ontology Cellular Components. With ongoing benchmarking and an effort to develop an appealing and informative visualisation of the results we are looking forward to your feedback and to bring this project to a close.
