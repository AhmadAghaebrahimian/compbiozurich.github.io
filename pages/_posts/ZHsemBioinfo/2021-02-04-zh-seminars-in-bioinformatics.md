### Protein-protein interaction prediction using co-evolution based method

It has been found that protein families  consisting of  orthologous proteins  usually show  divergent  sequence similarities due to amino acid mutations in evolutionary history while structures of   protein families  are usually  much more conserved. This phenomenon can be explained by two types of mutant positions in the protein sequence. One is conserved  regions across the protein family  and  even a slight change in this region could result in critical loss of protein structure or function.  Another is the so-called compensated mutation or coevolution region in protein.  This means if one residue mutates, other residues that in close contact or functionally related to the mutant residue often need to show compensated mutation to locally restabilize protein structure and function.

This type of residue-residue coevolution can be and have been intensively used  to study protein three-dimensional (3D) structure and functions within the same protein (family), while considering intra-and inter-protein co‑evolution involve similar physical interaction forces and evolutionary constraints, I’m trying  to apply and adapt these methods to predict protein-protein interactions networks.
