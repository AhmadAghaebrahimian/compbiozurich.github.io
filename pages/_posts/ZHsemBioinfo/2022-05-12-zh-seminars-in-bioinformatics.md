### The resemblance is uncanny a.k.a how similar are cancer cell lines really to their origins?

* Thursday, {{page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

Cancer cell lines are good and inexpensive models to study disease mechanisms and identify possible new drugs, However, many times cancer cell lines have been found to be either misidentified or contaminated. Additionally, cancer cell lines only represent a small clonal population of the origin as well as accumulate some additional mutations during in vitro handling. <!--more--> By studying cancer genomes and cancer cell linesâ€™ genomes, we would be able to determine which of these cell lines are the closest to their origins and thus best to use in research.
