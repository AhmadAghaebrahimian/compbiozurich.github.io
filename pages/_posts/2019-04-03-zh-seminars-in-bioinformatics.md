### Polyploid crop genome assembly by optical genome mapping and homeolog specific genomics analysis

* Wednesday, 2019-04-03
* 12:15 in Y-55L-12, UZH Irchel campus

<!--more-->

*Abstract* I will show the latest update of Finger millet genome assembly
scaffolded by Bionano Saphyr at chromosomal length scale. I will
introduce yet another polyploid analysing tool called EAGLE-RC and
show some results on the resequencing data.
