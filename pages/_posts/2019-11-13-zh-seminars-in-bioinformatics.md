*Abstract* I will talk about the extended enrichment functionality in STRING, which accepts whole genomes or proteomes with values, including RNASeq, microarrays, ranked genomes, protein abundances, etc. 
A high-powered enrichment of various annotation databases such as GO-terms is computed within a minute.

Also, I will talk about what we can learn from analyzing the usersâ€™ inputs in an aggregated fashion, as well as providing a preliminary comparison of enrichment results between our new enrichment and a similar tool, GSEA.
