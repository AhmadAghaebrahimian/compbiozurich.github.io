*Abstract* West Nile virus (WNV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are responsible for 
central nervous system (CNS) diseases including encephalitis, Guillian-Barré 
syndrome and congenital neurological abnormalities in the developing fetus. 
A successful immune response must carefully balance pathogen elimination against 
destruction of the host’s CNS. To study these diseases in detail, we analyzed 
the cellular composition of virally infected mice tissue by high-dimensional 
flow (30-parameter) and mass (47-parameter) cytometry along with Imaging 
Mass Cytometry™ and characterized and contrasted the evolving immune response 
over time. These approaches elucidate critical mediators of immunity and disease 
in WNV and ZIKV encephalitis and establish a methodology for determining the 
factors driving pathogenesis.
