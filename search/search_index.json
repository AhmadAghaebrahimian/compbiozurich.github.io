Topics covered in the lecture are e.g.: a term definition for bioinformatics the relation of hypothesis driven and data driven science, with respect to bioinformatics categories of bioinformatics tools and data research areas and topics the varying emphasis on \"bio\" and \"informatics\" databases (primary vs. derived) and data curation data collection & curation file Formats, ontologies & APIs ass areas/topics (w/o details) \"not-bioinformatics\" The lecture also presents the upcoming topics of the series. [2022 lecture slides] (PDF) [2022 podcast recording] Q & A 1 What is meant with prose in bioinformatics? Prose refers to written text, e.g. the body of scientific publications or descriptions of experimental procedures, which may contain much information that can be converted into categorical data, relationships and so forth. As example, a study may refer to its topic as genomic analysis of \"tumor samples from pre-menopausal women with estrogen receptor positive stage II breast cancer\". This information may not appear in any structured data provided through deposition repositories and may have to be associated with e.g. genomic profiling data through text mining & data curation. What is the difference between local and connected databases? Connected databases are open for networked queries or provide parts for complex data schemas - e.g. annotation data in one resource can be linked with molecular data in another using shared identifiers. Local ones are, well, local - e.g. storing data for experimental runs or sensitive clinical data in a protected environment. What does the slide with the arrayMap data Pipeline exactly show? It Depicts a \"typical\" bioinformatic data curation process - scripting, review, integration. For a binary file to get created is a program needed that will transform my data into such a file? Binary files are software specific, so one needs original software (think 2 - Microsoft Word) or compatible implementations - think Apple Pages - to create and interpret the data. Text based data formats - FASTA, HTML, XML, JSON, tabular text like .csv or .tsv - can be \"read by humans\". A computer cannot open any file of any format, what kind of software does the computer need? an API? See above. An API would be an internal part of the software, but has a broader meaning (e.g. it can also serve to read or write text based data in/from a structured format - e.g. put data from a JSON data stream into the right columns into a table). In the file formats BED and VCF genomic regions are stored. Does the whole sequence get stored as it is or is it somehow encoded? Both formats are not used to store contiguous sequences but rather \"features\" related to genomic coordinates (e.g. an allelic variant). Sequences are stored in FASTA, BAM, CRAM ... is an API just a piece of code written in perl, python or R? ... or any other programming language, to allow digital - digital interactions between different systems or parts of the same. What exactly is the difference between systems biology and bioinformatics? \"Exactly\" is tricky; generally it is \"transformation, visualization and interpretation of data\" in bioinformatics versus more data modeling and prediction (where prediction also needs data, but the with a stronger theoretical component; think prediction of protein structure or the behaviour of ecosystems).

To this end, typically PCR-amplified fragments of universal taxonomic marker genes are sequenced and quantified to generate taxon abundance tables. These tables can then be analyzed to determine the composition and diversity of, and the differences between microbial communities.

Topics covered in the lecture are e.g.: a term definition for bioinformatics the relation of hypothesis driven and data driven science, with respect to bioinformatics categories of bioinformatics tools and data research areas and topics the varying emphasis on \"bio\" and \"informatics\" databases (primary vs. derived) and data curation data collection & curation file Formats, ontologies & APIs ass areas/topics (w/o details) \"not-bioinformatics\" At the end of the lecture, a - very - brief introduction into the relevance of different aspects of bioinformatics for human genome variation is being given. Q & A 1 What is meant with prose in bioinformatics? Prose refers to written text, e.g. the body of scientific publications or descriptions of experimental procedures, which may contain much information that can be converted into categorical data, relationships and so forth. As example, a study may refer to its topic as genomic analysis of \"tumor samples from pre-menopausal women with estrogen receptor positive stage II breast cancer\". This information may not appear in any structured data provided through deposition repositories and may have to be associated with e.g. genomic profiling data through text mining & data curation. What is the difference between local and connected databases? Connected databases are open for networked queries or provide parts for complex data schemas - e.g. annotation data in one resource can be linked with molecular data in another using shared identifiers. Local ones are, well, local - e.g. storing data for experimental runs or sensitive clinical data in a protected environment. What does the slide with the arrayMap data Pipeline exactly show? It Depicts a \"typical\" bioinformatic data curation process - scripting, review, integration. For a binary file to get created is a program needed that will transform my data into such a file? Binary files are software specific, so one needs original software (think 2 - Microsoft Word) or compatible implementations - think Apple Pages - to create and interpret the data. Text based data formats - FASTA, HTML, XML, JSON, tabular text like .csv or .tsv - can be \"read by humans\". A computer cannot open any file of any format, what kind of software does the computer need? an API? See above. An API would be an internal part of the software, but has a broader meaning (e.g. it can also serve to read or write text based data in/from a structured format - e.g. put data from a JSON data stream into the right columns into a table). In the file formats BED and VCF genomic regions are stored. Does the whole sequence get stored as it is or is it somehow encoded? Both formats are not used to store contiguous sequences but rather \"features\" related to genomic coordinates (e.g. an allelic variant). Sequences are stored in FASTA, BAM, CRAM ... is an API just a piece of code written in perl, python or R? ... or any other programming language, to allow digital - digital interactions between different systems or parts of the same. What exactly is the difference between systems biology and bioinformatics? \"Exactly\" is tricky; generally it is \"transformation, visualization and interpretation of data\" in bioinformatics versus more data modeling and prediction (where prediction also needs data, but the with a stronger theoretical component; think prediction of protein structure or the behaviour of ecosystems).

Thanks to advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and computational power, microbial communities can now be studied without the need to cultivate them in a laboratory setting. Essential tasks in studying microbial communities include the identification and quantification of their member taxa and the pair-wise compositional comparison of different microbial communities. To this end, typically PCR-amplified fragments of universal taxonomic marker genes are sequenced and quantified to generate taxon abundance tables. These tables can then be analyzed to determine the composition and diversity of, and the differences between microbial communities. By random (shotgun) sequencing of total community DNA samples, it is, although still challenging, possible to reconstruct microbial draft genomes by a series of steps including metagenome assembly and binning.

Thanks to advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies and computational power, microbial communities can now be studied without the need to cultivate them in a laboratory setting. Essential tasks in studying microbial communities include the identification and quantification of their member taxa and the pair-wise compositional comparison of different microbial communities. To this end, typically PCR-amplified fragments of universal taxonomic marker genes are sequenced and quantified to generate taxon abundance tables. These tables can then be analyzed to determine the composition and diversity of, and the differences between microbial communities. By random (shotgun) sequencing of total community DNA samples, it is, although still challenging, possible to reconstruct microbial draft genomes by a series of steps including metagenome assembly and binning. This way, it is possible to access genomic information of organisms that cannot be readily studied under laboratory conditions. Such approaches have revealed an immense, underexplored taxonomic and gene functional diversity of our microbial world.

The tool includes visualizations in terms of \u2018impact maps\u2019 which additionally provide insight into whether the RBP acts in an activatory/inhibitory manner. Applying our approach to RBP knock-down experiments we were able to identify both novel and well-known regulators of splicing and/or polyadenylation.

However, for practical reasons, multiplexed single cell RNA-sequencing remains the most widely used technology for profiling transcriptomes of single cells, especially in the context of large-scale anatomical atlassing. Devising techniques to accurately predict the latent physical positions as well as the latent cell-cell proximities of such dissociated cells, represents an exciting and new challenge. Most of the current approaches rely on an \u2018autocorrelation\u2019 assumption, i.e., cells with similar transcriptomic profiles are located close to each other in physical space and vice versa. However, this is not always the case in native biological contexts due to complex morphological and functional patterning. To address this challenge, we developed SageNet, a graph neural network approach that spatially reconstructs dissociated single cell data using one or more spatial references. SageNet first estimates a gene-gene interaction network from a reference spatial dataset. This informs the structure of the graph on which the graph neural network is trained to predict the region of dissociated cells. Finally, SageNet produces a low-dimensional embedding of the query dataset, corresponding to the reconstructed spatial coordinates of the dissociated tissue. Furthermore, SageNet reveals spatially informative genes by extracting the most important features from the neural network model. We demonstrate the utility and robust performance of SageNet using molecule-resolved seqFISH and spot-based Spatial Transcriptomics reference datasets as well as dissociated single-cell data, across multiple biological contexts.

Even though the burden has decreased due to the deployment of different interventions in recent years, all those gains are threatened by biological threats that largely affect the success of different control strategies. The parasite uses different mechanisms to escape diagnostic tools and drug treatment, challenging one of the key control strategies, based on prompt detection and case management. Sequencing technologies, especially Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) have played a major role in understanding parasite genomic variation including drug resistance, diagnostic resistance, and population structure. However, exploring more advanced technology such as Third generation/long-read sequencing technologies might be worthy in terms of information that can be generated. Both whole genome sequencing and long reads could provide information on the complex genomic region of the parasite compared to short-read sequencing technologies. We propose to develop a whole genome long-read-based assay with Oxford Nanopore (Minion) to explore variations including structural variation. We hypothesize that more information on drug resistance gene, hrp2/3 gene, and parasite diversity will be obtained from this assay and will add value on the usefulness of the MMS on informing the performance of interventions to the NMCPs. We will develop an assay-based Nanopore technology, as it is relatively cheap and easy to implement in malaria-endemic countries. We also aim to develop a bioinformatics pipeline that will be useful for calling and visualization variants obtained from long-read sequencing data, the pipeline will be useful for all countries implementing MMS.

With this dataset will explored on sequence coverage, quality, ability to detect complexity of infection and profiling drug resistance our aim is to assess how these technologies can complement each other in terms information generated and their applicability in MMS. We will develop a long-read assay for variation detection using culture strains with known drug resistance, hrp2/3, and diversity profile; we will explore different methods of DNA extraction, DNA enrichment, and selective Whole Genome Sequence (sWGS), and at each point will assess DNA yield and sequence coverage will also be assessed. A bioinformatic pipeline will be developed for data analysis and making the use of long-read sequence data, this will be done by exploring/evaluating different tools/software and the best-performing ones will be used to develop a full pipeline.

Sequencing runs typically generate millions of reads in which the vast majority of the reads has an average error rate below 1/1000. However, some paired-end sequencing data show the presence of a subpopulation of reads where the second read (R2) has lower average qualities. We show that the fragment length is a major driver of increased error rates in the R2 reads. Fragments above 500 nt tend to yield lower base qualities and higher error rates than shorter fragments. We use publicly available Illumina data to demonstrate that the fragment length dependency of the R2 read qualities exists in various library protocols, in different labs and using different sequencer models. Our finding extends the understanding of the Illumina read quality and has implications on error models for Illumina reads.

Many early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between cell types (or clusters), and thus are focused on finding markers for cell populations (experimental units are cells).

Furthermore, the abundance of cell populations can have an association with a covariate that has additional information about the sample, such as treatment group, age, sex, survival time, etc. In differential abundance analysis, the goal is then to find cell populations whose abundance changes according to a covariate. One approach is to fit linear models to find those relationships. A problem occurs if a covariate is not always completely observed, but instead for some samples only a minimum value is known. This type of missing data mechanism is known as censoring and occurs frequently in the analysis of survival times. The simplest way to deal with censored covariates is to discard all samples containing incomplete data. But for small sample sizes or high censoring rates, this method becomes highly inefficient and might even introduce a bias. Better is therefore to directly take into account the censored nature of a covariate, which can be achieved with a similar setup as when a covariate is missing: multiple imputation. The main difference to classical multiple imputation is the imputation step which uses a censoring specific method. A comprehensive simulation study was performed by testing six different methods under various conditions. One method in particular, called Kaplan-Meier imputation, showed a good performance in terms of detection rates and error control. It detects much more reliably differentially abundant cell populations for small samples sizes with high censoring rates than the case where incomplete samples are discarded.","title":"Censored predictors in single cell regression models"},{"location":"news/ZHsemBioinfo/2020/2020-04-16-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","text":"12:15 (Skype Call) Abstract In addition to vertically transferring genes to their descendants, bacteria can horizontally transfer genes to other members in their community.

Multiple factors have been shown to affect the rate of horizontal gene transfer. First, the genetic relatedness of the donor and recipient plays a role. Second, bacteria in host-associated environments such as the human gut tend to participate in horizontal gene transfer more often. Finally, bacteria associated with the same environment tend to participate in horizontal gene transfer more often than bacteria from different environments.

These signatures are further observed at non-CpG sites, resembling methylation context observed in specialised cell types, including neurons and oocytes. We further show that these preferences are not mediated by the differential recruitment of the two de novo DNMTs to the genome but are resulting from structural differences in their catalytic domains. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that, in case of DNMT3A, the preference is due to favourable polar interactions between the flexible Arg836 side chain and the guanine that base-pairs with the cytosine following the CpG. This context-dependent de novo DNA methylation provides additional insights into the complex regulation of methylation patterns in different cell types.","title":"Flanking sequence preference modulates _de novo_ DNA methylation in the mouse genome"},{"location":"news/ZHsemBioinfo/2020/2020-07-02-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","text":"template: post.html title: Deciphering the contribution of mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression in mESCsdescription: 'Zurich Seminars in Bioinformatics - Moritz Sch\u00e4fer' authors: - '@mbaudis' date: 2020-07-02 12:00 in Y-55L-06, UZH Irchel Campus and 12:15 om ZOOM Call Abstract In mammals, a number of distinct mechanisms govern the regulation of gene expression. MicroRNAs are ~21nt RNAs that repress mRNAs by forming a complex with Argonaute proteins and binding to the mRNA 3\u2019UTR. The individual knockout of several RNAi genes, involved in miRNAs biogenesis, leads to a large number of misregulated genes. Nevertheless, only a small number of misregulated genes were commonly observed in all RNAi mutant mESCs. Indeed, the different deletion mutants show a very different differential gene expression patterns, raising the question of which specific mechanisms are responsible for the large number of misregulated genes in individual mutant cell lines. In order to identify the leading causes, I integrated several OMICs data obtained from these RNAi mutant mESCs, as well as publicly available datasets. I observed that chromatin-associated regulation mechanisms like histone modifications are perturbed and contribute greatly to the observed deregulation. Furthermore, I present an attempt to integrate descriptive data for chromatin opening, histone modifications, transcription factors and miRNA-mediated regulation to gain an understanding of what contributes most to the deregulation of genes in individual microRNA-depleted cells.","title":"2020 07 02 zh seminars in bioinformatics"},{"location":"news/ZHsemBioinfo/2020/2020-07-09-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","text":"HiDRA-seq: High-Throughput SARS-CoV-2 Detection by RNA Barcoding and Amplicon Sequencing 12:00 in Y-55L-06, UZH Irchel Campus and 12:15 om ZOOM Call Abstract The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus that causes a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in humans (SARS-CoV-2) has developed into a global pandemic with over 11 million reported cases and more than 530,000 deaths worldwide.

While point mutations can be pinpointed to a targeted genetic element, copy number variations (CNVs) involve copy number gain or loss of a large DNA segment which often covers hundreds of genetic elements in one event. Although the vast majority of variations are not directly fucntionally cancer promoting, we observe consistency in CNV landscape within the same cancer types and corresponding increase in heterogeneity along with increased distinction in physiology and morphology. This implies that particular CNV may promote cancer type-specific progression. Previously, it was observed that a focal CNV (with length shorter than 3Mb) indicated stronger functional relevance than large-scale CNV. In addition, we observe higher frequency of CNV segment start and end points near known driver genes. Taken together, we designed a statistic that harness properties of collective CNV segments, to delineate the non-random alteration of genes exerted through CNV. Using 9 different cancer types from multiple sources and platforms, we ranked all genes in the genome for their importance based on the CNV data. The same cancer types cluster together by genome-wide significance scores. Known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can be found at the top. We have also compared with GISTIC2.0 using the same data and identified similar regional peaks, but this method can provide significance measure on the gene level. With the confirmatory results on the known tumor promoting genes, this work has a potential to identify novel functional pathways that are exerted through CNV.","title":"Discovering copy number variation across multiple cancer types"},{"location":"news/ZHsemBioinfo/2021/2021-05-06-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","text":"12:15 om ZOOM Call","title":"A morphometric framework for the embryo-wide quantification of tissue organisation at single cell resolution"},{"location":"news/ZHsemBioinfo/2021/2021-05-20-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","text":"DNA methylation is on the base level a binary mark.

These new technologies generate high-throughput, highly-multiplexed in-situ data, enabling the interrogation of biological systems at an unprecedented level of detail. In comparison to current single-cell technologies that analyse suspen- sions of single cells, extracted from cell cultures or tissues, these technologies do not only elucidate cellular compositions of tissues, but also recapitulate actual cell-cell interactions in their native microenvironment. Information about this cellular interactome creates new opportunities to study biological heterogeneity from a spatial perspective and to better understand disease mechanisms, paving the way for the exploration of new therapeutic approaches. Similar to the transition from bulk sequencing to single-cell sequencing, these technologies introduce new computational challenges in terms of how the generated data is handled and analyzed. To fully exploit these data sets, novel computational methods and data standards need to be developed to accommodate the wide range of resolutions, multiplexing and modalities (e.g., genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) produced by di\u21b5erent technologies. In this thesis, we develop a computational framework to visualise spatial omics data and characterize biological heterogeneity in a spatially informed way.

For the cell lines to be accurate representations of the disease, they would need to be genetically highly similar to their primary neoplasias. Another issue when working with cell lines is the possible contamination or misidentification of the cell lines. To address both of these concerns, the genetics of both cancer cell lines and their origins will need to be evaluated. Cancers as well as cancer cell lines exhibit copy number variation (CNV) profiles that show regions in the chromosomes that have been deleted or amplified. Similarity assessment of these CNV profiles along with examining single nucleotide variants as well, enable the detection of cell lines that are the most accurate representations of the disease. Therefore, we have been building an extensive knowledge resource for cell line copy number and single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

We propose conducting cell type annotation in a probabilistic framework to fill the gap incomplete references create. As a way to connect new results with existing knowledge coming from flow cytometry from the past 50 years, we have established a ground truth based on the ADT portion of CITE-seq data. Furthermore, we have applied different probabilistic single-cell classification methods on the RNA portion of the data and compared the inferred cell-type labels among them. Using only one reference dataset, we present this work as a proof of concept that needs to be extended to establish a conclusive method comparison.

Due to the difficulty of multi-omics integration, the Cox Proportional-Hazards (Cox PH) model using clinical data has remained one of the best-performing methods [Herrmann et al., 2021]. This motivates the need for new models which can successfully perform multi-omics integration in survival models and outperform the Cox PH model. Furthermore, there is a strong need to make multi-omics models more sparse and interpretable to encourage their usage in clinical settings. We developed a novel neural architecture, termed Supervised Hierarchical Autoencoder (SHAE), based on supervised autoencoders and Sparse-Group-Lasso regularization. Our new method performed competitively with the best performing statistical models used for multi-omics survival analysis. Moreover, it outperformed the Cox PH model using clinical data. We further showed that surrogate linear models for SHAE trained on a subset of multi-omics groups achieved competitive performance at consistently high sparsity levels, enabling usage within clinics. Alternatively, surrogate models can act as a feature selection step, permitting improved performance in arbitrary downstream survival models.","title":"Supervised Hierarchical Autoencoders for Multi-Omics Integration in Cancer Survival Models"},{"location":"news/ZHsemBioinfo/2021/2021-10-21-zh-seminars-in-bioinformatics/","text":"12:15 UZH Irchel Y55-l-06/08 and ZOOM Call The adaptive immune system is remarkable for its ability to produce immunoglobulins that can specifically bind to a wide variety of antigens.

Despite advances in studying prophages using whole-genome sequencing, challenges in identifying and locating inducible prophages within their host have limited our understanding of phage-bacterial interactions. We established and experimentally validated methods based on DNA sequencing data to locate inducible prophages in bacterial genomes. This method, implemented as a bioinformatic tool named mVIRs, identifies prophages by analysing the orientation and apparent insert size of paired-end reads aligned to a reference genome and locates the exact genomic coordinates by partially aligned reads. The output of mVIRs builds the foundation to quantify phage-to-host ratios as relative prophage activity levels. Applying mVIRs in four murine model strains, we detected and located six inducible prophages. We also show that mVIRs is applicable to gut microbial community samples, using either publicly available or de novo assembled genomes as reference for the alignment of sequencing reads. Comparing experimentally validated prophage locations to the results from several computational detection tools revealed that phage predictions were both variable and inconsistent across such tools, with only one out of 46 predictions agreeing with the experimentally validated coordinates.
