## Bioinformatics Teaching

### Ph.D. Level

Zurich's research groups in Computational Biology are host to a highly diverse group of international Ph.D. students. Entrance into the Ph.D. program is provided by the <a href="https://www.lifescience-graduateschool.uzh.ch/">Zurich Life Science Graduate School</a> via highly competitive Ph.D. programs that are administered jointly by the ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich. These programs aim to attract the most promising young scientists from across the world to Zurich. For questions about Ph.D. studies please contact the <a href="https://www.lifescience-graduateschool.uzh.ch/">Graduate School</a> or individual group leaders directly.

### Masters Level 

Three competitive Masters Programs provide a wide array of teaching and research activities, and they attract a diverse group of international students. These programs are administered jointly by the ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich.

#### [Computational Biology & Bioinformatics](https://www.cbb.ethz.ch/)

The goal of the program is to provide students with a broad education in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, based on strong foundations in Computer Science, Biology and Mathematics. The curriculum includes practical cources with experimental and computational components, because cooperation and communication are key to success in this highly interdisciplinary field.The interdisciplinary character of the program is reflected in the policy of admitting applicants holding Bachelor degrees in a wide range of disciplines.

#### [Neural Systems and Computation](https://www.nsc.uzh.ch/en.html)

This program provides skills and expertise in systems and computational neurosciences, and in neuromorphic engineering disciplines. Students are offered an education in classical works that reflect our current understanding of the architecture of the brain and its sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. An essential part of this program is to offer hands-on research experience in experimental and theoretical neuroscience disciplines, and in unexplored territories relating to vision, sensorimotor coordination, birdsong, brain circuit reconstructions, vision sensors, and more.

#### [Statistics](https://stat.ethz.ch/teaching/master)

Statistical methods are essential in almost all fields of today's scientific world. Increasingly complex problems and data demand the development of adequate statistical methods. The program emphasizes cutting edge research topics, such as statistical applications in genomics and transcriptomics. Students may select one of three major directions, statistical methodology, applied statistics, and biostatistics.The program especially aims at recruiting students holding a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, physics, statistics, computational science or a related subject.
