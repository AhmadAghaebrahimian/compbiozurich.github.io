As of 2019-03-25, the _compbiozurich.org_ webste is being hosted as a Github project.
This move will allow an "open contributions" structure, in which members of Zurich's Bioinformatics & Computational Biology community can participate in content creation.
Typical examples of such user-driven updates could be:

* seminar announcements
* links to resources - software, databases, teaching materials - maintained by members of the _CompbioZurich_ community
* job postings
* information about teaching events and programs

Site edits can be done through standard Github mechanisms. Please don't hesitate to [contact Michael](https://info.baudisgroup.org/group/Michael-Baudis/) with questions, comments or suggestions.
