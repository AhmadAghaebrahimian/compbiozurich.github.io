**Abstract** I will present the latest advances in cryo-electron microscopy and how this technique allows to solve protein structures at fast pace also of difficult protein targets, thus revolutionizing the field of structural biology and biomedicine. I will then focus on the recent developments on solving the structure of a ion channel that is located in rod photoreceptors of the retina, a protein complex that was discovered nearly 35 years ago and its structure has finally being revealed ([article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41594-021-00700-8)).

The analysis of this structure opens up the hypothesis of mRNA editing (A to I editing) at one specific site, a modification that was reported for other ion channels expressed in the brain. I am thus very excited to discuss this hypothesis with those of you that deal with the analysis of tissue-specific mRNA sequencing datasets.
Hope it will be of any interest.
