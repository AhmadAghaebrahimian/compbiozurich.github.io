The [compbiozurich.org](http://compbiozurich.org) website has been redesigned
based on the Mkdocs framework & using the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) template system.<!--more-->

Most relevant content has been lifted over, but there are some additional
changes needed - e.g. the [Teaching](/teaching/) section is rather empty at this time - this should change benfore the start of the '22 Autumn semester.
