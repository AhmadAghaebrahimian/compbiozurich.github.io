*Abstract* Doubtless there are GO terms in your enrichment analysis you shouldn't see. Mass Spectrometry based shotgun-proteomics is inherently biased towards abundant proteins. This bias can influence GO-term enrichment analysis by showing enriched terms for abundant rather than e.g. post-translationally-modified (PTM) proteins.<!--more--> We have developed a method to correct for this bias and a freely accessible web-tool [agotool.sund.ku.dk](https://agotool.sund.ku.dk/) to facilitate the use for the scientific community. Now, after an eternity has passed, we are back and in the process to overhaul and expand this tool to satisfy a user near you.
