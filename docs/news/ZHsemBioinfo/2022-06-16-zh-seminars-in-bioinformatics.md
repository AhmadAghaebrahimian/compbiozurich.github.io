**Abstract** The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme catalyzes site-specific self-cleavage and was first discovered in the single-stranded circular RNA virus HDV. HDV-like ribozymes (DRZ) share the conserved nested double-pseudoknot structure motif. Through a bioinformatic search using an adapted minimal active DRZ motif, we discovered hundreds of novel minimal DRZ sequences in bacteriophage genomes associated with the human microbiome. A subclass of these hits was identified to occur in direct conjunction with viral tRNA genes, indicating that we have found a solely RNA-based factor that can site-specifically cleave tRNA 3'-trailers, thus making large protein enzymes redundant for this task.
