__Abstract__ In high-throughput sequencing data, performance comparisons between computational tools are essential for making informed decisions in the data processing from raw data to the scientific result. Simulations are a critical part of method comparisons, but for standard Illumina sequencing of genomic DNA, they are often oversimplified, which leads to optimistic results for most tools.<!--more-->

ReSeq improves the authenticity of synthetic data by extracting and reproducing key components from real data. Major advancements are the inclusion of systematic errors, a fragment-based coverage model and sampling-matrix estimates based on two-dimensional margins. These improvements lead to a better representation of the original k-mer spectrum and more faithful performance evaluations. ReSeq and all of its code are available at: [github.com/schmeing/ReSeq](http://github.com/schmeing/ReSeq).
