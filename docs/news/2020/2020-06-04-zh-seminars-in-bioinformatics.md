__Abstract__ We present **distinct**, a statistical method to perform, via hierarchical
permutation tests, differential analyses between groups of densities. distinct can be
applied to a variety of datasets, and is particularly suitable to perform differential
analyses on single cell data.  

While most methods for differential expression target differences in the mean abundance
between conditions, single-cell data can show more complex variations. **distinct**, by
comparing full distributions, identifies, both, differential patterns involving changes
in the mean, as well as more subtle variations that do not involve the mean.  

We will present results, based on single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-dimensional
flow or mass cytometry(HDCyto) simulated and experimental datasets.

**distinct** is freely available as a Bioconductor R package.
