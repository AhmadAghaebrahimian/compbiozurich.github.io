# BIO392 - Bioinformatics of Sequence Variation

This is a repository for materials related to the BIO392 _Bioinformatics of Sequence Variation_ introductory course at the University of ZÃ¼rich. The course takes place in each Autumn semester (September/October).

## Summary

One of the fastest growing areas of bioinformatics is in the analysis, warehousing and representation of genomic and protein sequence variants, particularly with view on the use of molecular data in personalised health and biomedical applications in general. This course will engage participants to explore common data formats, online resources and analysis techniques, with a focus on human genome variation data.

* 4 weeks at the start of each Autumn semester
* UZH Irchel campus, [Y-01F-01](/img/Y01-F-50-location.png)
* Course language is English
* BIO392 HS 2022 in the [UZH OLAT](https://lms.uzh.ch/auth/RepositoryEntry/17250386425/CourseNode/85421310414617) system
* BIO392 HS 2022 in the [UZH directory](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/index.html#/details/2022/003/SM/50920456)

### Technical requirements

* the course lab is equipped with iMacs - however, feel free to use your personal machines (which may anyway be advantageous for "home office" work)
* you will need to have / create a [Github](https://github.com) account (though
this is also addressed at the beginning of the course)
