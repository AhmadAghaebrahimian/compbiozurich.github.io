<h2> Afternoon </h2>
The aim of day 07's afternoon session will be to give an overview of a typical bioinformatics pipeline. 
The different steps and computational tools that are needed to get from raw sequencing reads to variant calls will be introduced. 
Finally, we will discuss why repetitive genomic regions are difficult to analyse, as this will be the topic of the practical work on days 08 and 10.
